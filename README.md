# IDS/IPS Benchmarking Solution

## Detailed Information Document uploaded in "securenet-innovators.pdf" file in the repository

# Pending Tasks:
Improving the User Interface and User Experience of our tool.

## Overview
This project, developed by Team **SecureNet Innovators**, provides a benchmarking tool for evaluating the performance of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) based on key metrics like throughput, latency, and detection accuracy. The repository also provides a sample IDS/IPS solution under varied conditions and uses metrics aligned with the methodologies outlined in [RFC 9411: Benchmarking Methodology for Network Security Device Performance](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9411).

## Objectives
The tool benchmarks custom IDS/IPS devices across:
- **Throughput**
- **Latency**
- **Detection Accuracy**

## Key Features
1. **Traffic Profiles**: Supports various traffic conditions, including regular and attack traffic profiles.
2. **Signature Complexity**: Analyze how the complexity of signatures affects IDS/IPS performance.
3. **Latency and Packet Drop Measurement**: Provides real-time insights on packet drop and latency variations as traffic increases.
4. **Adaptive Traffic Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts traffic to simulate real-world load spikes for stress testing.
5. **Machine Learning Analysis**: Uses ML models to predict failure points and optimize IDS/IPS configuration.
6. **Interactive Visualizations**: These are real-time visualizations of throughput, latency, and accuracy, allowing for deeper performance insights.

## Installation Process
Clone the repository:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/indiainternetfoundation/securenet-innovators.git
cd securenet-innovators
```

See individual instructions for each part in the Directory folder.

## Timeline
**Expected Delivery Date**: 1st December 2024
